The issue was that tests were not properly isolated and could be affected by config files left by other tests.\\n\\n**Critical Project Files (MUST NOT be modified by tests):**\\n- etc/arda.toml - User's actual project configuration file\\n- Any actual project files, configs, or data files\\n\\n**Audit Tasks:**\\n1. Search for all tests that interact with filesystem operations\\n   - Tests creating/reading/writing config files\\n   - Tests that use Path.cwd(), Path.home(), or other path operations\\n   - Tests that access project directories (etc/, .config/, etc.)\\n\\n2. Identify tests that should use isolation:\\n   - Tests reading config files → Should use temporary directories or mocking\\n   - Tests writing files → Should use temporary directories, not project dirs\\n   - Tests accessing cwd/home → Should use mocking/patching\\n\\n3. Check for proper isolation patterns:\\n   - @pytest.fixture(autouse=True) for cleanup\\n   - tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() for isolated file operations\\n   - unittest.mock.patch for path operations\\n   - Proper teardown in fixtures\\n\\n4. Specific tests to examine:\\n   - All tests in arda_cli/tests/integration/config/\\n   - Any tests that reference:\\n     * Path.cwd()\\n     * Path.home()\\n     * etc/arda.toml\\n     * .config/arda/\\n     * Project file operations\\n\\n5. Verify cleanup:\\n   - Autouse fixtures for state cleanup\\n   - Temporary directories cleaned up after tests\\n   - No persistent state between tests\\n\\n**Expected Outcome:**\\n- List of all tests that need file operation isolation\\n- Identification of tests that might be modifying project files\\n- Recommendations for adding isolation where missing\\n- Ensure etc/arda.toml and other project files are never touched by tests\\n\\n**Priority:** Prevent test pollution and ensure tests only operate in isolated environments.","notes":"Audit Complete: All tests properly isolated! ✅\n\nSummary:\nConducted comprehensive audit of all test files in arda_cli/tests/ that perform file operations. Found that ALL tests use proper isolation mechanisms - no test pollution possible.\n\nTests Audited (all properly isolated):\n1. test_config_workflow.py - Uses tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() + clean_config_state() autouse fixture\n2. test_main_extended.py - Uses runner.isolated_filesystem() from Click\n3. test_vm_operations.py - Uses TempDirectory context manager with proper cleanup\n4. test_parses_valid_toml.py - Uses tmp_path fixture (pytest built-in)\n5. conftest.py - Provides mock_path_home/cwd and reset_modules autouse fixture\n6. base.py - Provides temp_dir and temp_config_dir fixtures\n\nKey Findings:\n- ✅ All file operations use temporary directories or mocking\n- ✅ etc/arda.toml (user's actual config) never modified by tests\n- ✅ All references to config files are in isolated contexts\n- ✅ Multiple cleanup mechanisms: autouse fixtures, context managers, tmp_path\n- ✅ No test pollution possible\n\nIsolation Patterns Used:\n- runner.isolated_filesystem() - Click's CliRunner\n- tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() - Python built-in\n- tmp_path fixture - Pytest automatic\n- TempDirectory context manager - Custom with cleanup\n- @pytest.fixture(autouse=True) - Automatic cleanup\n- monkeypatch - For Path operation mocking\n\nConclusion:\nTest suite demonstrates excellent isolation practices. The clean_config_state() fixture added earlier ensures complete isolation.

Created 'flakes' Command Group\n- Added `pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/__init__.py` (package marker)\n- Added `pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/main.py` (command group)\n- Integrated into main CLI via `pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/main.py`\n\n### 2. Implemented 'flakes create' Command\n- File: `pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/create.py`\n- Validates world name (alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores)\n- Copies template files using `shutil.copytree`\n- Initializes git repository\n- Runs `nix flake update` to fetch dependencies\n- Creates initial commit\n- Rich progress indicators and error handling\n\n### 3. Created Template System\n- Directory: `templates/arda/default/`\n- `flake.nix` - References arda-core, exports nixosConfigurations and devShells\n- `arda.nix` - Inventory system for hosts, services, features, and roles\n- `README.md` - Comprehensive user guide\n- `modules/common.nix` - Example NixOS module\n\n### 4. Added Age Key Generation\n- Creates `.sops/age/keys.txt` for secrets management\n- Uses `age-keygen` command with error handling\n- Provides age to CLI via package wrapper in `default.nix`\n- MakesWrapperArgs includes age in PATH\n\n### 5. Updated Flake Integration\n- Modified `pkgs/flake-module.nix` to export `arda-cli` as both package and app\n- Enables `nix run .#arda-cli -- flakes create ...`\n- Version bump to 0.1.7 to trigger rebuild with new files\n\n### 6. Updated MANIFEST.in\n- Ensures all new Python files are included in package distribution\n\n## Testing Results\n\nSuccessfully tested with Python module directly:\n```bash\ncd /home/ld/src/arda-core/pkgs/arda-cli\npython -m arda_cli.main flakes create test-world --force\n```\n\nCreates proper directory structure:\n```\n/home/ld/src/arda-core/pkgs/arda-cli/test-world/\n├── arda.nix           # Main configuration\n├── flake.nix          # Flake configuration\n├── README.md          # User documentation\n├── modules/\n│   └── common.nix     # Example module\n└── .sops/\n    └── age/\n        keys.txt       # Age encryption key\n```\n\n## Next Steps\nOnce the flake package rebuilds with version 0.1.7, users will be able to use:\n```bash\nnix run github:lorddevi/arda-core#arda-cli -- flakes create my-world\n```\n\nThis establishes the foundation for Arda's infrastructure management capabilities, enabling the creation of worlds that can be managed with arda-cli commands.\n\n## Files Changed\n- NEW: pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/__init__.py\n- NEW: pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/main.py\n- NEW: pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/create.py\n- MOD: pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/main.py (added flakes command)\n- NEW: templates/arda/default/flake.nix\n- NEW: templates/arda/default/arda.nix\n- NEW: templates/arda/default/README.md\n- NEW: templates/arda/default/modules/common.nix\n- MOD: pkgs/arda-cli/default.nix (age key support, version 0.1.7)\n- MOD: pkgs/flake-module.nix (export as app)\n\n## Technical Details\n- Uses click/rich-click for CLI (consistent with existing arda-cli)\n- Rich progress bars and themed output\n- Proper error handling with helpful messages\n- Template path resolution: goes up from `.../commands/flakes/create.py` to arda-core root\n- Git integration with automatic initialization and commit\n- Flake update with warning handling (warnings are normal on first run)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-01T17:20:15.001169343-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-01T17:20:32.350375694-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-01T17:20:32.350375694-05:00","close_reason":"Successfully implemented 'flakes create' command for arda-cli.

{"id":"arda-progress-bar-log-mixing","title":"Progress bar and timestamped logs appear on same line","description":"During world creation, the progress bar description 'Creating world...' is shown, but then timestamped logs like '[2025-12-01 21:43:08] [WARN]...' appear on the same line instead of on a new line. This makes the output look messy and hard to read. The logs should either appear on their own line before/after the progress bar, or the progress bar should be properly completed before logs are printed. Looking at the output, it seems like the progress update calls don't add newlines, and logging happens while the progress bar is still active.","status":"in_progress","priority":3,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-01T21:45:00Z","updated_at":"2025-12-01T21:48:14.411364897-05:00"}

Offers selection options (select it, select all)\n\nThis suggests clan's approach is more robust for users who may have multiple age keys or want to reuse existing keys. Need to:\n1.
