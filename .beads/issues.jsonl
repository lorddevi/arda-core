The issue was that tests were not properly isolated and could be affected by config files left by other tests.\\n\\n**Critical Project Files (MUST NOT be modified by tests):**\\n- etc/arda.toml - User's actual project configuration file\\n- Any actual project files, configs, or data files\\n\\n**Audit Tasks:**\\n1. Search for all tests that interact with filesystem operations\\n   - Tests creating/reading/writing config files\\n   - Tests that use Path.cwd(), Path.home(), or other path operations\\n   - Tests that access project directories (etc/, .config/, etc.)\\n\\n2. Identify tests that should use isolation:\\n   - Tests reading config files → Should use temporary directories or mocking\\n   - Tests writing files → Should use temporary directories, not project dirs\\n   - Tests accessing cwd/home → Should use mocking/patching\\n\\n3. Check for proper isolation patterns:\\n   - @pytest.fixture(autouse=True) for cleanup\\n   - tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() for isolated file operations\\n   - unittest.mock.patch for path operations\\n   - Proper teardown in fixtures\\n\\n4.

Created 'flakes' Command Group\n- Added `pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/__init__.py` (package marker)\n- Added `pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/main.py` (command group)\n- Integrated into main CLI via `pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/main.py`\n\n### 2. Implemented 'flakes create' Command\n- File: `pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/create.py`\n- Validates world name (alphanumeric + hyphens/underscores)\n- Copies template files using `shutil.copytree`\n- Initializes git repository\n- Runs `nix flake update` to fetch dependencies\n- Creates initial commit\n- Rich progress indicators and error handling\n\n### 3. Created Template System\n- Directory: `templates/arda/default/`\n- `flake.nix` - References arda-core, exports nixosConfigurations and devShells\n- `arda.nix` - Inventory system for hosts, services, features, and roles\n- `README.md` - Comprehensive user guide\n- `modules/common.nix` - Example NixOS module\n\n### 4. Added Age Key Generation\n- Creates `.sops/age/keys.txt` for secrets management\n- Uses `age-keygen` command with error handling\n- Provides age to CLI via package wrapper in `default.nix`\n- MakesWrapperArgs includes age in PATH\n\n### 5. Updated Flake Integration\n- Modified `pkgs/flake-module.nix` to export `arda-cli` as both package and app\n- Enables `nix run .#arda-cli -- flakes create ...`\n- Version bump to 0.1.7 to trigger rebuild with new files\n\n### 6. Updated MANIFEST.in\n- Ensures all new Python files are included in package distribution\n\n## Testing Results\n\nSuccessfully tested with Python module directly:\n```bash\ncd /home/ld/src/arda-core/pkgs/arda-cli\npython -m arda_cli.main flakes create test-world --force\n```\n\nCreates proper directory structure:\n```\n/home/ld/src/arda-core/pkgs/arda-cli/test-world/\n├── arda.nix           # Main configuration\n├── flake.nix          # Flake configuration\n├── README.md          # User documentation\n├── modules/\n│   └── common.nix     # Example module\n└── .sops/\n    └── age/\n        keys.txt       # Age encryption key\n```\n\n## Next Steps\nOnce the flake package rebuilds with version 0.1.7, users will be able to use:\n```bash\nnix run github:lorddevi/arda-core#arda-cli -- flakes create my-world\n```\n\nThis establishes the foundation for Arda's infrastructure management capabilities, enabling the creation of worlds that can be managed with arda-cli commands.\n\n## Files Changed\n- NEW: pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/__init__.py\n- NEW: pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/main.py\n- NEW: pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/commands/flakes/create.py\n- MOD: pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/main.py (added flakes command)\n- NEW: templates/arda/default/flake.nix\n- NEW: templates/arda/default/arda.nix\n- NEW: templates/arda/default/README.md\n- NEW: templates/arda/default/modules/common.nix\n- MOD: pkgs/arda-cli/default.nix (age key support, version 0.1.7)\n- MOD: pkgs/flake-module.nix (export as app)\n\n## Technical Details\n- Uses click/rich-click for CLI (consistent with existing arda-cli)\n- Rich progress bars and themed output\n- Proper error handling with helpful messages\n- Template path resolution: goes up from `.../commands/flakes/create.py` to arda-core root\n- Git integration with automatic initialization and commit\n- Flake update with warning handling (warnings are normal on first run)","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","created_at":"2025-12-01T17:20:15.001169343-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-01T17:20:32.350375694-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-01T17:20:32.350375694-05:00"}

PRE-COMMIT HOOK IS WORKING CORRECTLY during git commit:\n   - The pytest hook has 'always_run: true' which ensures it always runs\n   - It runs both test phases (test-without-core and test-with-core)\n   - When tests pass: Shows \"Passed\"\n   - When tests fail: Shows \"Failed\" and blocks the commit\n\n2. WHAT THE USER SEES AS \"SKIPPED\":\n   - Many other hooks show \"Skipped\" because no staged files match their patterns\n   - Examples: ruff, ruff-format, check-json, etc. show \"(no files to check)Skipped\"\n   - This is NORMAL and EXPECTED behavior - hooks only run on files they match\n\n3.

Listing all methods in the Flake class related to caching\n2. Comparing against existing tests in test_nix.py  \n3. Identifying methods with zero test coverage\n\n## FINDINGS\n\n**CRITICAL:** The following core methods have **ZERO tests** despite being central to the caching system:\n\n1. ❌ **`get_from_nix()`** - Fetches attributes from Nix and caches them (138 lines)\n2. ❌ **`precache()`** - Ensures selectors are cached (30 lines)\n3. ❌ **`select()`** - Cache-integrated attribute selection (35 lines, partially tested)\n4. ❌ **`_record_cache_miss()`** - Tracks cache misses (9 lines)\n\n**CURRENT STATE:**\n- 107 tests pass ✓\n- 67.87% coverage for nix.py ✓\n- BUT: Core caching methods are completely untested ✗\n\n## RISK\n\nWithout these tests:\n- Bugs in core caching logic may go undetected\n- Cache integration issues won't be caught\n- Cache miss tracking may be unreliable\n- Error handling in cache operations is untested\n\n## SOLUTION\n\nCreate 8 comprehensive tests covering:\n1.

{"id":"arda-gdh","title":"Project Accessibility \u0026 Mental Model Planning Discussion","description":"OBJECTIVE: Comprehensive summary of LLM accessibility issues and project mental model goals. Present all discussed recommendations and gather guidance on next steps.\n\nCONTEXT - THE PROBLEM:\narda-core has a dual-nature architecture that confuses LLMs:\n1. arda-core is a DEVELOPMENT repository (source code, not for end-users)\n2. End users NEVER clone arda-core - they use: `nix run \"https://...#clan-cli\" --refresh -- flakes create`\n3. This creates a NEW local repository (template flake) that is managed via `nix develop`\n4. Current README.md shows wrong workflow (clone + develop) misleading LLMs\n5. LLMs frequently ask \"how do I install arda?\" because they don't understand this dual nature\n\nLLM ACCESSIBILITY RECOMMENDATIONS (4 items discussed):\n\n1. **Serena Memory Approach** (PRIORITY):\n   - Create \"project_mental_model\" serena memory\n   - Contents: Architecture summary, dual-nature explanation, clan relationship\n   - Instantly accessible to every LLM without reading docs\n   - Need guidance: What should/shouldn't be included? Split into multiple memories?\n\n2. **AGENTS.md Architecture Section**:\n   - Add \"Project Architecture \u0026 Mental Model\" section after MCP servers\n   - Highlight critical dual-nature points only\n   - Explain dev repo vs generated user repos\n   - Reference Serena memory for complete details\n\n3. **README.md Complete Overhaul**:\n   - Split into \"For Developers\" vs \"For End Users\" sections\n   - Remove misleading clone+develop workflow\n   - Show actual nix run + flakes create flow for end users\n   - Show git clone + nix develop for contributors only\n\n4. **History Cleanup**:\n   - Contents of history/ folder contain important research docs\n   - Plan: Complete Issues 1 \u0026 2 first (nix + testing verification)\n   - Then DELETE history/ contents (keep empty folder for future artifacts)\n   - Currently has 4-5 research files documenting clan-core analysis\n\nDELIVERABLES REQUIRED FROM DISCUSSION:\n1. What should be included in the \"project_mental_model\" serena memory?\n2. Should it be one comprehensive memory or split into smaller focused memories?\n3. What key architectural points MUST LLMs understand immediately?\n4. What's the priority order for implementing these 4 recommendations?\n5. Any other project accessibility concerns we should address?\n\nCRITICAL SUMMARY REQUIREMENTS:\n- This summary must capture 100% of context for any LLM to continue work with zero knowledge\n- Include original problem that triggered this discussion\n- Include all 4 recommendations with full explanation\n- Include short-term goals (verify research) and long-term goals (LLM accessibility)\n- Include technical details about dual-nature architecture\n\nSTOP: After discussion and guidance from user on how to proceed with mental model creation.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-04T23:31:50.51363398-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-04T23:31:50.51363398-05:00"}

{"id":"arda-y7g","title":"Fix inconsistent colors between 'arda' and 'arda --help'","description":"The colors in help output were different between 'arda' and 'arda --help' commands.\n\nWhen using the solarized theme, the 'Active configuration:' line and other text had different colors depending on which command was used. This occurred because different code paths were used to determine the theme in each case.\n\nROOT CAUSE:\n- When running 'arda --help': The eager --help callback runs BEFORE main() is called, so ctx.params and ctx.obj are empty. The callback had a hardcoded 'dracula' default instead of reading from the config file.\n- When running 'arda' (without --help): main() runs first, loads config, and populates ctx.obj with the correct theme from config.\n\nSOLUTION:\n1. Modified show_help_with_config() to read theme from config file when not found in ctx.params, ctx.obj, or sys.argv\n2. Added explicit --theme parsing in main() for consistency\n\nThis ensures both 'arda' and 'arda --help' use the exact same theme from the config file, producing identical colored output for all text including the 'Active configuration:' line.\n\nFiles changed:\n- pkgs/arda-cli/arda_cli/main.py (show_help_with_config and main functions)\n\nTested: nix flake check passes, all VM tests pass, and both commands now produce identical colored output.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-02T10:43:33.234097468-05:00","updated_at":"2025-12-02T10:43:38.493688985-05:00","closed_at":"2025-12-02T10:43:38.493688985-05:00"}
